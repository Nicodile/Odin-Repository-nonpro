# Why Odin
I am currently going through Odin because I want to learn both programming, writing and Art. Im not very interested in Web design. But gaining the basics / Core competencies of it will help with learning new skills and even creating my own blog if needed.
## What is this for
All my repos that are not for "projects" of the material such as: html boilerplate or "lists"
